[Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) is module bundler which can bundle your assets and javascripts to one or several files. 

We will now transform our previous SpringBootReact project to use webpack. [repository](https://github.com/juhahinkula/SpringBootReact.git)

Here is the steps that you have to do

1.) Create webpack configuration file (webpack.config.js) in the root directory

'entry' is the location of your code where webpack builds a dependency graph.
'output' is the location and name of the bundled file.

{% highlight javascript %}
module.exports = {
  entry: './src/main/webapp/public/App.jsx',
  output: {
    path: __dirname + '/src/main/webapp/public', 
    filename: 'bundle.js' 
}   
... 
{% endhighlight %}

2.) Add loaders to webpack configuration file
